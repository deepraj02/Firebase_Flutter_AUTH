# firebase_flutter_auth
I have documented the process of setting up Firebase for a Flutter application.

	Add firebase_core package to your pubspec.yaml and do  necessary changes as documented in the firebase setup page.
	In case you get any sort of error related to the api level change the following in the App Level Gradle File

			minSdkVersion 21

			targetSdkVersion 30
